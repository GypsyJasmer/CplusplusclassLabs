Lab #4
ou were to check for three values, please add a loop to main that does this

getArraySize should use constants (DONE)

srand should be in main, not createArray (NEED HELP)

createArray should use constants (DONE)

getInteger should use constants (NEED HELP) //why if not needed in code elsewhere?

binarySeach has a bug that was in my code, should be < not <= (NEED HELP I didn't use Jim's binary search meaning I didn't have <=)

====

Looks good overall, please fix these issues and resubmit
